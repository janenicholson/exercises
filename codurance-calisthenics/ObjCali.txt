====================

The Rules
1.	Don’t abbrev. (iate)
2.	Don’t use the ELSE keyword (or else!)
3.	No static methods other than factory methods (and even then consider using an IOC container)
4.		Keep all entities small (50 lines per class, no package over 10 files).
5.			One level of indentation per method 
6.		One.dot.per.line 
		(unless using functional chaining such as the builder pattern or functional chaining of an
 		immutable type e.g. linq in .net languages)
7.	Wrap all primitives (strings count)
8.	First class collections 
9.	No classes with more than 2 instance variables.
10.	No get/set methods
